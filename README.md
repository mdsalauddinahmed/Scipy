# Scipy
## what is SciPy
A very popular library in python
- SciPy is a free and open source python library used for scientific computing and technical computing
- It is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extention of python
- Its adds significant power to the interactive python session y providingthe user with high-level commands and classes for manipulation and visualizing data
- SciPy builds on NumPy and therefore if you import Scipy,there is no need to import numpy

  ## Sub Packages in SCiPy
  - scipy.cluster
  - scipy.constraints
  - scipy.fftpack
  - scipy.integrate
  - scipy.interpolation
  - scipy.linalg
  - scipy.io
  - scipy.ndimage
  ## scipy.cluster
  There are two types of clustering which are:
  - central
  - Hierarchy
    ## Let us consider an example:
  - In the demo, we will use NumPy to generate two sets of random points.
  - After joining both these sets, we whiten the data.
   - Whitening normalizes the data and is an essential step before using k-means clustering.
   - Finally, we use the k-means functions and pass it the data and number of clustered we want
